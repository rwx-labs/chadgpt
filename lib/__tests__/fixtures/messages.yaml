    Here's a JavaScript function called `removeRepeatedLines` that removes repeated lines in a given string, and also prints the lines that are repeated with the number of times they occur:

    ```javascript
    function removeRepeatedLines(str) {
      const lines = str.split('\n');
      const lineCount = {};
      const uniqueLines = [];

      lines.forEach(line => {
        if (lineCount[line]) {
          lineCount[line]++;
        } else {
          lineCount[line] = 1;
          uniqueLines.push(line);
        }
      });

      // Print repeated lines with their count
      for (const line in lineCount) {
        if (lineCount[line] > 1) {
          console.log(`"${line}" repeated ${lineCount[line]} times.`);
        }
      }

      // Return the string without repeated lines
      return uniqueLines.join('\n');
    }

    // Example usage
    const input = `Hello
    World
    Hello
    JavaScript
    World
    Hello`;

    const result = removeRepeatedLines(input);
    console.log('-----');
    console.log(result);
    ```

    This function first splits the input string into lines, and then iterates through the lines to count the occurrences of each line. It also keeps track of unique lines in an array called `uniqueLines
